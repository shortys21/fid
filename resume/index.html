<h3>Profile</h3>
<p>Visual Creative with over 20 years experience working for various retailers; delivering visual merchandising, in store marketing and project management expertise which represents a unique combination of disciplines. Personally, I have demonstrated drive and determination to consistently achieve success as a leader in all of the organizations I have worked with. My passion lies in establishing systems and processes which allow team members to achieve objectives. By empowering team members in decision making to achieve acceptance of decisions and approaches they can deliver project objectives within time, resource, and budgetary constraints. My success can largely be attributed to facilitating cooperation, establishing openness and creativity; motivating teams to inspire a sense of teamwork and instilling ownership and urgency throughout each phase of design. I believe in designers with a broad skill set who can provide solutions to everyday problems and needs. One must have the ability to see past themselves to keep the organization moving forward while maintaining relevance.</p>
